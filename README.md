# Hey, I'm Andre 👋

**Software Developer** building thoughtful web experiences and exploring systems programming.

Currently deepening computer science fundamentals through [Launch School](https://launchschool.com/) while working on production web applications and declarative infrastructure with NixOS.

---

## 🔭 Current Focus

- **Learning:** Computer science fundamentals through Launch School's mastery-based curriculum
- **Building:** Maintaining production sites (Astro/TypeScript) and client projects
- **Exploring:** Declarative system configurations with NixOS and functional Nix
- **Investigating:** WebGL fluid simulations for technical visualizations

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

```
Languages:    TypeScript · JavaScript · Nix · HTML5 · CSS3 · Python · PHP
Frameworks:   Astro · Vue · Nuxt · React · Node.js · TailwindCSS
Tools:        Git · Linux/NixOS · Sanity CMS · WordPress · GCP
Interests:    Component architecture · Performance · Accessibility · DevOps
```

## 🌟 Featured Work

### Production & Client Work
**[Lunarium Spokane](https://lunariumspokane.com)** - Web app for local tea lounge  
`Astro · TypeScript · TailwindCSS · 95+ Lighthouse`

### Open Source Libraries
**[cosmic-schemas](https://github.com/AndreBClark/cosmic-schemas)** `14★ 3🔱` - Sanity schema types for SEO management  
**[astro-loader-groqd](https://github.com/AndreBClark/astro-loader-groqd)** - Type-safe Sanity loader for Astro  
**[sanity-plugin-mermaid](https://github.com/AndreBClark/sanity-plugin-mermaid)** `2★` - Mermaid diagrams for Sanity V3

### Systems & Tooling
**[nixconfig](https://github.com/AndreBClark/nixconfig)** - Declarative NixOS system configurations

## 💡 What I Value

- **Thoughtful engineering** over quick hacks
- **User experience** as a first-class concern  
- **Code quality** and maintainability
- **Learning deeply** rather than collecting frameworks
- **Building useful things** not AI hype

## 📊 Context on Activity

My contribution graph shows lighter activity during 2023-2024 because I was:
- Enrolled in Launch School's intensive program (500+ hours completed)
- Working in private client repositories  
- Deep-diving into NixOS (mostly local configuration work)
- Building foundations through computer science study

My public work represents a fraction of my actual development - quality and learning over GitHub streak metrics.

## 💼 What I'm Looking For

**Remote software development roles** where:
- Engineering excellence matters more than shipping fast
- Teams value maintainable, well-tested code
- User experience drives product decisions
- Learning and growth are supported
- AI/ML hype is optional (or absent)

**Ideal roles:** Frontend, full-stack, or systems-oriented positions at product companies building genuinely useful tools.
